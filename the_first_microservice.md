# The First Microservice

For this chapter, please checkout the `v2` tag: `git checkout v2`.

Notice the addition of the billing application under the `applications` directory. This is our first microservice, and will allow us to scale this functionality independent of the subscription behavior.

TODO:
It would be nice if it leveraged one of the same components already used by the subscriptions application, so the re-usability could be highlighted.
